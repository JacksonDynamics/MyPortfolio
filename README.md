# PortfolioPage

#### This is my portfolio page, updated and added to as time goes on. Constantly improving. Currently adding project links to my portfolio section. The languages used are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
 
#### I am proud of the work that I have accomplished now and basically have my Portfolio page the way I want it to look! I love being able to learn how to read and write code better to organize my thoughts into something presentable.
